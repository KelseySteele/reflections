1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, you are getting a file ready to be added to git. You need to do it so that you can
put the file on gitHub.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and
the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is not yet within git, it is where you work on projects locally. The repository is a folder
where you store files on the working directory and on git. The staging areas is where files get ready to be commited to git.
I think these different areas are valuable because you can try different codes locally without overcrowding
your git repository.
